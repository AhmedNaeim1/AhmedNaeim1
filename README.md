### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ahmed Naeim  
Iâ€™m a Software Developer with a deep interest in Generative AI, intelligent systems, and mobile-first experiences. Iâ€™ve built multi-agent AI systems, RAG-based document search pipelines, and production-grade mobile apps using Flutter â€” and contributed to projects at IBM, Microsoft, Vodafone, and Optomatica.

Currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Artificial Intelligence while continuing to build and learn at the intersection of LLMs, microservices, and mobile interfaces. Most excited about the future of agent-based systems, AI-enhanced user experiences, and real-world GenAI integrations.

ðŸš€ I love clean code, practical AI, and the challenge of turning abstract models into products people can use.
